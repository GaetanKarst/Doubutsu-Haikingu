# Doubutsu-Hikingu

_This application is my first MVP project made in 2 days and was developed during my time as student at Code Chrysalis._

**Deployed project:** https://doubutsuhaikingu.herokuapp.com/

Doubutsu Haikingu is an application allowing users to take a picture of an animal, plant or any other element of the nature you've encountered during your hikes.
